        <h3>Washington Mews, New York</h3>
        <p>October 2011. In the streets of Washington Mews in NY, Ethan and his friend Joey were studying at the Elmer Holmes Bobst library in the evening. When they left the library and were heading home their eyes couldn’t believe what they just saw right in front of them. An unconscious man being dragged through the ground towards an alley. </p>
        <p>Ethan went to search for the man, but Joey refused to come along. As Ethan tried to search for him, the culprit and the victim were gone – no traces to be found. Confused as Ethan was, Joey suddenly disappeared.</p>
        <p>While Ethan was dazzled about the situation and was wandering aimlessly, he encountered a stranger right after his brother’s disappearance. The stranger told him that his brother has been taken to another parallel universe, but Ethan didn’t know what to say.</p>
        <p>“Come with me, there’s no time to waste if you want to save your friend”, said the stranger. As desperate Ethan was he chose to go along with him.</p>

        <p>Ethan was taking to Elizabeth, Union Count in New Jersey. When Ethan entered the stranger’s house, he was taken to his lab immediately. The stranger introduced himself as a scientist named Liam. Liam showed Ethan his invention – a time machine. </p>
        <p>Without a second thought and questioning his credibility, Ethan desperately wanted to go back in time to save his friend from disappearing. Liam started the machine as Ethan wanted it so badly – time was set in place.</p>

        <h3>Washington Mews, New York II</h3>
        <p>When Ethan opened his eyes, he saw Joey walking with him on the same street again. He was so overwhelmed to see him that he began to hug him – Joey was a bit confused.</p>
        <p>Again, Ethan saw the same person being dragged through the same alley. This time he insisted Joey to follow him instead of leaving him behind. To Ethan’s surprise, the culprit was gone with the victim again.</p>
        <p>“Bang!”, shots were fired. Ethan thought he was getting shot at, but when he looked to his left it was Joey who got shot. He couldn’t believe it.</p>
        <p>By taking Joey with him, Ethan thought that he could save him, but he ended up dying. When the situation became more drastic and confusing, Liam appeared as he heard the gunshots.</p>
        <p>Ethan was angry with Liam as he told him that he came back in time from a time machine made by him. Liam didn’t think that it could work, but at the same time he told Ethan that you can’t 100% save someone by going back in time.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing that, Ethan became furious and couldn’t think clear. But it was his mistake as he unhesitant use the time machine without knowing its cons.</p>

        <h3>Elizabeth, Union County, New Jersey II</h3>
        <p>Ethan begged Liam and told him to use his time machine again. As they entered the house, Ethan rushed towards to lab without wasting a second. When Ethan walked into the room his eyes stared intensely at the time machine.</p>
        <p>Liam told Ethan that for every time he’s using the time machine he creates a new parallel universe. Ethan didn’t care a bit about the consequences and only wanted to save Joey.</p>
        <p>Once again Liam started the machine despite warning Ethan – time was set in place.</p>

        <h3>Washington Mews, New York III</h3>
        <p>Ethan slowly opened his eyes to only find Joey shaken him up. Joey could see that Ethan looked very exhausted and tired. On their way home from the library, Ethan once again saw the same person being dragged through ground.</p>
        <p>Ethan anxiously told Joey to ignore the scene, and the let the police handle it. “We can’t”, said Joey. Joey could see that Ethan was very troubled by something since he knows him very well. While they were arguing on what to do, an unknown man in a hoodie came out.</p>
        <p>The culprit started to run, and for some reason Joey began to run after him impulsively while Ethan shouted at him to stop.</p>
        <p>They ran around a corner, while Ethan tried to catch up – shots were fired. Again… He found his friend dead in front of him. No feeling could describe the emptiness inside of him. Tears were hidden in the rain that was pouring down from the sky.</p>
